# Production-and-Machine-Performances
Cleaning Data and analysis for production and machine performances data

## Business Background
PT. Temprina Media Grafika production process begins with the creation of a work order (SPK) and production staff carry out production according to the SPK. Despite following Work Orders (SPKs) closely, production often takes longer than planned, leading to increased costs. To identify the root causes of these delays, the company is analyzing different production processes. By understanding which processes are more likely to deviate from the planned timeline, we can implement targeted improvements to streamline production and reduce costs.

## Problem Statement
To enhance overall production efficiency and reduce costs, the company must pinpoint specific production processes that are underperforming. By identifying these areas of concern, we can implement targeted improvements to optimize workflows, reduce waste, and ensure that production standards meet or exceed expectations.

## Goal
To identify the root causes of these delays, by understanding which processes are more likely to deviate from the planned timeline, we can implement targeted improvements to streamline production and reduce costs.

## Analytic Approach
To identify the most problematic production processes, we'll follow a data-driven approach. First, we'll clean and prepare the production data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Next, we'll conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, and potential outliers within the data. Finally, we'll perform hypothesis testing to statistically determine which production processes have the largest deviations in duration. By rigorously analyzing the data, we can pinpoint the areas that require the most significant improvements to optimize overall production efficiency and reduce costs.
